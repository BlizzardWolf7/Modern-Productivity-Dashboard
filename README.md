## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Weather Not Loading

**Problem**: Weather shows "Loading..." indefinitely

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Allow location access in browser settings
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Try refreshing the page

### Location Permission Denied

**Problem**: Location shows "Location access required"

**Solutions**:
1. Click the 🔒 icon in browser address bar
2. Allow location access
3. Refresh the page
4. If still blocked, check browser privacy settings

### Tasks Not Saving

**Problem**: Tasks disappear on page refresh

**Solutions**:
1. Check if localStorage is enabled
2. Verify browser is not in private/incognito mode
3. Check available storage quota
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### Settings Not Persisting

**Problem**: Settings reset on page reload

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure localStorage is enabled
2. Check browser privacy settings
3. Verify cookies/storage not being cleared on exit
4. Try a different browser to isolate the issue

### Toast Notifications Not Appearing

**Problem**: No toast notifications visible

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify CDN connection (check Network tab)
3. Ensure internet connection is stable
4. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Checking Connection Status

**How to Check**:
1. Open settings (⚙️ icon in top-right)
2. Expand the "Connection" section (🌐)
3. Look at the "Status" indicator
4. Green dot + "Online" = Connected to internet
5. Red dot + "Offline" = No internet connection

**Note**: The app works offline thanks to the service worker, but some features (weather, location) require an internet connection.

### Clearing App Cache

**When to Clear Cache**:
- App not loading latest updates
- Service worker issues
- Testing or debugging

**How to Clear**:
1. Open settings (⚙️ icon in top-right)
2. Expand the "Connection" section (🌐)
3. Click "🗑️ Clear App Cache" button
4. Confirm the action
5. App will reload automatically

**Important**: Clearing cache removes cached files (HTML, CSS, JS) but **keeps all your tasks, notes, and settings safe** in localStorage.

### PWA Auto-Updates

**How It Works**:
- The app automatically checks for updates every 5 minutes
- When a new version is detected, it installs in the background
- A toast notification appears: "Update found! Installing new version... 🔄"
- The app automatically reloads to activate the new version
- Your tasks, notes, and settings remain safe during updates

**How Updates Are Detected**:

The update system uses a multi-step process:

1. **Service Worker Versioning** (`sw.js`):
   - Each version has a unique cache name (e.g., `productivity-dashboard-v1.0.8`)
   - When you update your code, you change the version number in `sw.js`

2. **Periodic Checks**:
   - Every 5 minutes, the app calls `registration.update()`
   - This forces the browser to check if `sw.js` has changed

3. **File Comparison**:
   - Browser compares the current `sw.js` file with the one on the server
   - If they differ (byte-by-byte comparison), it's a new version

4. **Background Installation**:
   - New service worker downloads and installs in the background
   - `updatefound` event fires when new worker is detected
   - Original service worker keeps running (no interruption)

5. **Automatic Activation**:
   - App sends `SKIP_WAITING` message to new service worker
   - New worker calls `skipWaiting()` to activate immediately
   - `controllerchange` event fires and app reloads
   - New version is now active

**Key Points**:
- Updates only detected if `sw.js` file changes on server
- Cache name change forces new resources to download
- Old cache automatically deleted on activation
- localStorage (tasks/notes/settings) never touched

**No Action Required**: Updates happen automatically when you're using the PWA. Just keep the app open and it will stay up-to-date!

**Manual Update**: If you want to force an update, you can:
1. Clear the app cache (Settings → Connection → Clear App Cache)
2. Or refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)

### Checking App Version & Updates

**View App Information**:
1. Open settings (⚙️ icon in top-right)
2. Expand the "Guide & About" section (📖)
3. View app details:
   - **Version**: Current app version (v1.0.8)
   - **Last Updated**: Date of last app update
   - **Last Checked**: When the app last checked for updates

**Understanding "Last Checked"**:
- Shows relative time (e.g., "Just now", "2 minutes ago", "1 hour ago")
- Updates automatically every 60 seconds while viewing settings
- Stored in localStorage and persists across sessions
- Reset to current time every 5 minutes when update check runs
